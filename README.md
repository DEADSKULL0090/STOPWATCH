# Stopwatch and Clock Application (Python GUI)

This project is a simple Python GUI app that functions as both a real-time clock and a stopwatch. Built using Tkinter, it allows users to view the current time and measure elapsed time with Start, Stop, and Reset buttons.

## Features

- Live display of current time (HH:MM:SS)
- Stopwatch with start, stop, and reset functionality
- Intuitive interface using Tkinter

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries (only uses built-in `tkinter`, `time`, `datetime`)

## How to Run

```bash
python stopwatch_clock.py
```

## Example UI

- Top: Current system time (updated every second)
- Middle: Stopwatch time (00:00:00 initially)
- Bottom: Start, Stop, Reset buttons
